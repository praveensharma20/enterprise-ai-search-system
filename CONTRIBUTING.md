# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this RAG demo project.

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
- Open a clear PR with a description and testing steps.
- Keep changes focused and include tests where appropriate.
- Run linters and formatters before opening a PR.

If you'd like to add a major feature (persistence, auth, production deploy), open an issue first to discuss the approach.
